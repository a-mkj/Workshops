This workshop teaches basic data manipulation with Python using the Pandas library, and will cover topics such as loading data into and out of a Pandas `DataFrame`, performing basic data cleaning, preparation, and analysis, and visualizing relevant aspects of a dataset.

### Prerequisites:
You should be familiar with basic Python syntax and fundamental programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. If you need a refresher, check out A Byte of Python (https://python.swaroopch.com/).
