With these in hand, you'll know enough to write simple scripts and begin to explore other features of the language.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to write and run Python code in an interactive way. They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications. If you'd like to install a Python distribution locally, though, we have some instructions (with gifs!) on installing Python through the Anaconda distribution, which will also help you handle virtual environments: https://github.com/sul-cidr/Workshops/wiki/Installing-and-Configuring-Anaconda-and-Jupyter-Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into problems, or would like to look into other ways of installing Python or handling virtual environments, feel free to send us an email (contact-cidr@stanford.edu) or visit us during our [consulting hours](https://library.stanford.edu/research/cidr/consulting).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be possible to follow along with this workshop using a regular Python console (\"terminal\", \"command-prompt\", etc.)  Please note however that we will not be able to support you with problems related to a local environment during this workshop, and we do recommend using the Colaboratory notebooks if you are at all unsure."
