## Git

### Why do we care about version control and git?

- Addresses issue of multiple versions and drafts of files
- Provides capacity to easily move between different versions of files (a la Google Sheets, but locally)
- Facilitates collaboration
- Facilitates backup and storage through remote repositories

### Conceptual model of git

- Local directory/working directory
- Staging area
- Git repository
- Remote repository

### Setting up git

- Installing
- Working with your git config
  - Username
  - Email

### Initializing a local git repository (`git init`)

### Telling git what to keep track of (`git add`)

### Telling git when to take a snapshot of your tracked files (`git commit`)

### Practice:

### Collaborating with git (fixing merge conflicts)

### Advanced collaboration (the branching model)
